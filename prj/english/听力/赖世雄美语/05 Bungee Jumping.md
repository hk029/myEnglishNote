# lesson 5 Bungee Jumping

```
Bungee Jumping looks like fun, It makes me nervous just to watch someone do it. It certainly takes lots of guts to jump 1000 feets above the water with only a rope tied to your legs. It scars me just to think about it. However it is something I really want to do one day. Some people think I am crazy. they say to jump is foolish enough, but have to pay for it is madness. But I don't agree, for me to live a short and execting life is far better than to live a long and boring one. what do you think.
