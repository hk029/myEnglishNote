## 课文

```
	Smoking is bad in that it is harmful to one's health. In spite of the fact that doctors have even warned that it causes cancer, people still keep on smoking. 
	In some Western countries, however, people are beginning to kick the bad habit. They realize that health should come first. To help them quit smoking, there are laws against cigarette advertising and smoking in public places. This is praiseworthy except that Western countries are now selling cigarettes in the East in greater numbers than ever. That they are doing this is immoral, don't you think? 
```

## In spite of the fact that doctors have even warned that it causes cancer, people still keep on smoking.

- `in spite of` =`despite`  + the fact that 从句 (都视为介词，所以后面要加the fact)

- keep (on)V-ing   on 可省略

  > If you keep studying, you will master English.
