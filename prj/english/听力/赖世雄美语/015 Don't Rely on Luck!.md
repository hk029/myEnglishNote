# Lesson 15 **Don't Rely on Luck!**

## 课文

```
Passing exams is every student's dream.Failing them is their nightmare. So, to realize their dreams, many students try anything. They even go to fortunetellers, buy lucky charms and follow old customs. 
In Korea, many students bury something personal in the university they want to enter. They believe that these things will act as magnets and "pull" them into the university. Whether it works or not, nobody really knows. At least it does ease the students' minds about passing exams. Remember, though, you can't always rely on luck. There isnno substitute for hard work.
