```
Being thoughtful simply means thinking of others before yourself. What you say or do will have an effect on others. So it is important to think before you say or do anything. In this way you will avoid hurting others feelings. Moreover a thoughtless act or remark will spoil a perfect relationship. Remember this rule, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.Likewise, if you think what you do will hurt others, don't do it. After all, what gose around, comes around.

### What you say and do will have an effect on other people

1. have an effect `on`  对...有影响

   = impact  / influence 

   > We now know people have an impact on weather.

   ==so to speak. 也可以这么讲==

### So it is important to think before you say or do anything.

1. important = necessary = essential 

   <u>It is important that sb (should) do</u> 

   > It is important that he (should) be punctual. 

### In this way you will avoid hurting others feelings.

1. (in) this way

   > (in) This way, you will master(精通) Enlish.

2. feelings 感情（ 必须加s，否则表示感觉）

   > He scolded my feelings

### Moreover a thoughtless act or remark will spoil a good relationship.

1. `remark` 谈论，言论，评论

   > He `made` a interesting `remark` about me. 

2. spoil = hurt = undermine 

   spoil 溺爱，宠爱，破坏，变质（=go off)

### Remember this rule, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.

1. keep/remain `silent` **注意没有s, 是一个adj**
2. keep/`bear sth in mind` = rember sth by heart.

### Likewise, if you think what you do will hurt others, don't do it. 

1. `likewise` = `by the same token`

   > Yesterday was a lousy day, by the same token today isn't any better.
   >
   > `lousy` = awful = terrible 非常糟糕，讨厌

###  After all, what gose around, comes around.

1. after all 毕竟

2. ==what gose around, comes around.== 善有善报恶有恶报; 付出就有收获; 种瓜得瓜种豆得豆

   > whatever you do comes to you.
