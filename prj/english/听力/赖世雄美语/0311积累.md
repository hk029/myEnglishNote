Pollution is a big problem in almost all the big cities of the world. City people are therefore, becoming more and more worried about how they can get rid of pollution. They are also concerned about whether the government is doing enough to protect the environemnt.
However people in Ireland don't have these worries. They are sure they have found the answer to the problem. They use windmalls, these windmall can create power without creating pollution. These methods is so successful that other countries are thinking of doing the same. Why not? what works for Ireland can work for any other country.

C: May I have a word with you? 
W: Sure. What's the problem? 
C: It's about your son. I'm tired of his making so much noise at all hours of the day. 
W: I'm sorry. I'm sure he's not doing it on purpose. 
C: I'm sure he's not. But we can do without the noise pollution, you know? 
W: You're absolutely right. By the way, how was your party last night? It sure sounded like you had a great time.

Smoking is bad in that it is harmful to one's health. In spite of the fact that doctors have even warned that it causes cancer, people still keep on smoking. 
In some Western countries, however, people are beginning to kick the bad habit. They realize that health should come first. To help them quit smoking, there are laws against cigarette advertising and smoking in public places. This is praiseworthy except that Western countries are now selling cigarettes in the East in greater numbers than ever. That they are doing this is immoral, don't you think?

```
Jane is talking to her boyfriend. 
J: You promised me that you were going to give up smoking. What's that in your hand? 
B: I'm sorry. I really want to except that every time I get nervous, I can't help smoking. 
J: That's just an excuse. 
B: No. It's true. I've tried everything: chewing gum, biting my fingernails and even meditation, but nothing works. 
J: Well, if you want to be with me, you'll just have to quit cold turkey. 
B: That will work!
