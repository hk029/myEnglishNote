*[from E.T 35]*

### Brief Introduce

Thinking of going to an **exotic**, **tropical** destination? Well, let's have a look at some suggestions that will make your travels more rewarding and help local people too!



### Gold rule

Well, the golden rule for a true traveller is to **respect** the culture and environment of the country you're visiting. This is why l want to talk today about ethical travel. l'm not talking here about a weekend in Paris or a week on a Greek island but more about tourism to more distant locations in poor, developing countries.



### Ethical travel

 **Ethical travel** is all about what to do when you're on holiday in one of these countries. ** is all about what to do when you're on holiday in one of these countries. Sure. To start with, before you leave home try to choose a travel company that gives part of its **profits** to a **fund** that supports local community projects. You know, with traditional tourism only a very small percentage of the income generated by visitors actually goes to local people. Most of the money that tourists spend goes to **multinational** companies. Usually these companies take their profits out of the country and do very little to help local communities and the local environment. You're right! The tourist industry can be a very **cut-throat** business. 



### Other suggestions

So, do you have any other suggestions on how we can travel ethically? Sure, choose a **resort** that is built with local materials in the **local style** or stay in local family run hotels! Shop and eat where local people do, use public transport and try to learn a few words of the language before you leave home. The only way to really get to know a country is to **get in touch with** local people. So it can be useful to **read up on** the place you're going to visit and its culture before you leave home. Of course! Tourists usually see the local culture as something colourful and exotic without really understanding it very well. lt's important though to learn about local traditions and to respect them; do this and your holiday will be much more rewarding experience. One more thing: **do remember to always ask before taking photos**! 



And what about shopping? ls this against the concept of ethical travel? Absolutely not! Shopping's always fun! But do use your head when shopping! l mean try to buy souvenirs from local markets and always pay a **fair** price for goods, **bargaining's** fine but don't beat the locals down too much! One important thing, never buy souvenirs made from **endangered species**. This is illegal and damages the local ecosystem. 



### Summary

Fine, so an ethical traveller is a responsible tourist who knows how to **combine** the joys of travelling **with** a respect for the local culture and environment.
