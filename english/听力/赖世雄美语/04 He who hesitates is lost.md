## He who hesitates is lost

he who = anyone who = those who(复数) 凡是...的人

> He who works hard, will be successful.
>
> anyone who...
>
> those who `work` hard...



> `be lost in` = `be absorbed in` 沉迷于，专注于
>
> Don't talk to him, he is lost in his work.
>
> I was lost in the music.



> while (I was) **on vocation**, I visited Itatly and France.



## Are you have a good time?

> have a good time (in)`doing`= have fun（饭）  做...很愉快
>
> have a hard time/difficulty doing  做...很困难
>
> 
>
> He alwasy have a good time (in) camping
>
> I have a good time dancing.
>
> foreigner have a hard time learning `chinese character`(中国字)



## are you kidding? I <u>have the time of my life,</u> I love the concerts.

you must be kidding （me）! 你一定是在开玩笑

==have the time of my life== = have the greatest time. 最快乐的时光



## concert going is fantastic, but what else can we do?

concert going = going to the concert.

> 名词提前：house cleaning is Peter 's favorite activity.  = cleaning the house

`put on` = `hold`  v.举行（演出，展览）

!> 但是举行会议就只能用hold了，put on 一般跟娱乐性质的

> The artist will put on a exhibit next month.

`fantasitc` = `cool` = `awesome` = `terrific`  很棒！

`awful` = `terrible` 很差

## biking along the banks of the river Danube(多瑙河) coule be fun.

> bike/bicycle/`cycle` 都可以做动词，表示骑车

> along the banks 沿着河岸（两侧是复数）

> 表示建议，可能性从小到大：could < can < must < is fun

> fun 表示有趣n/adj
>
> funny 滑稽
>
> `make fun of` 取笑
>
> the students made fun of the new kids
>
> don't make fun of others.

## It sounds like a good idea, let's do it then.

> 感官动词 + like + n
>
> tastes like a garbage. 尝起来像垃圾
>
> pick up the garbage and throw it to garbage can(垃圾桶)

## You are right, as they say he who hesitate is lost

> as they say = as people say.
