# Lesson 11 Power without pollution

```
Pollution is a big problem in almost all the big cities of the world. City people are therefore, becoming more and more worried about how they can get rid of pollution. They are also concerned about whether the government is doing enough to protect the environemnt.

However people in Ireland don't have these worries. They are sure they have found the answer to the problem. They use windmalls, these windmall can create power without creating pollution. These methods is so successful that other countries are thinking of doing the same. Why not? what works for Ireland can work for any other country.
