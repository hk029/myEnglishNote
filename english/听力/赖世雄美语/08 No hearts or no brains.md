# Lesson 8 No hearts or no brains

```
Anna: I don't understand how people can think doctor K is doing the right thing.

Dick: well helping people die with dignity is not that bad is it?

Anna: Don't you know where there is a life there is a hope.

Dick: Come on, be realistic, those people who want to die is suffering. It is better that they go quickly and painlessly.

Anna: All you men have no hearts.

Dick: And all you women/'wɪmɪn/ have no brains.
