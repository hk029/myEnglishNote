## E-commerce

More specifically we spoke about e-retailing and online shopping. **Retailing** is the selling of goods directly to consumers. Consumers are the people who buy goods. So **online shopping** is buying things on the lnternet.



The **e-retail** market, that is the selling of goods online, is growing.



**Automatic comparison shopping**' means your browser  automatically shows you the prices of the same products at different online stores.



**To shop around** means visit different shops to look for the lowest price.



There are lots of **bogus companies**,these are companies that don't really exist.And lots of **scams**. A scam is a trick to steal money from people.
