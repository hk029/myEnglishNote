### kitchen environment

Well, to begin with, a kitchen environment should be well lit and have ample surfaces to work on. Also, plenty of **drawer** space is necessary for storage of food items and **utensils**. You don't need a **king-size** kitchen to enjoy cooking in it! What's important is organization and having things **at hand**.



### Essential Appliance

Well, obviously a **hob**, an **oven** and a **fridge** are absolutely essential. Today many people can't survive without a **dishwasher**( I'm one of those people! I really hate doing dishes!). In the US it's hard to find a kitchen without a microwave. **Microwaves** are quite useful especially for busy people. 



### optional appliances

Although they're not strictly necessary, they often **come in handy** in large families or when entertaining guests frequently. One is the **grill**, another is a **deep fryer** for large quantities of **chips** and other **titbits**. If you are a healthy eater, you will need a **steamer oven** like this one. 



Other appliances which are also common in the US are **water and ice dispensers**, like this one. Everybody seems to have a **food processor** these days. Why is a food processor so useful? since it's a real **space and time-saver**. It has many different functions: It can **mince meat**, **grate** cheese and vegetables, make **bread-crumbs**, pulp tomatoes, fruit and so on.





An **electric beater** like this can be used for **whisking** eggs as well as making mayonnaise. Other kitchen aids are **scales and measuring utensils**. Careful weighing and measuring are fundamental for successful cooking since recipes are generally in kilos and grams.
