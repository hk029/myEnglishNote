*[From E.T 33]*

### Brief Introduction

 the City of London is the financial heart of the UK. London is very small but very important in the world of **finance**. Did you know that **the City of London**, that's its full name, is just one square mile or 2.6 kilometres? And that only 7000 people live there? But more than 320,000 people a day **commute into** the City to work there.



### Why is London so important

The City is a global financial centre with hundreds of banks, **financial exchanges**, **insurance companies** and **investment** companies. You know, there are more than 500 companies in the City. And it also has several important **commodity markets**. The City's the place to buy commodities such as oil, gold and silver. ln the City people **carry out** all kinds of **financial transactions,** they borrow money, save money, invest money, buy and sell commodities, buy and sell insurance for all kinds of things, from **oil tankers** to **skyscrapers**!



Together with Tokyo and New York the City is one of the world's most important financial centres. lt's situated between the **time zones** of Asia and America. ln fact, offices in the City don't have just one clock, they have at least four, with clocks showing the time for Tokyo, Zurich and New York. 



Lots of other highly skilled people work there. For example many lawyers, accountants and computer experts work there. They help the banks and insurance companies to work smoothly. 



### Beautiful City

It's worth remembering too that the City's a beautiful place to visit. lt can be **ultra-modern** and **medieval** at the same time. There are some beautiful old buildings, especially the **churches**, and some **innovative** new buildings such as the **Lloyd's insurance building** and the **Swiss Re Building**, or the 'gherkin' as it's now known. But remember: don't visit the City at weekends! There's nobody there! And most of the shops and pubs are closed.

## Migration

*[From E.T 33]*

### what is migration

First of all let's look at the difference between 'migration' and 'immigration'. 



**Migration** is the movement of people from one country to another. A '**migrant**' is a traveller who moves from one country to another. There are two kinds of migrants: 1. **economic migrants**, who come from poor countries and look for work in Europe. 2. '**Asylum seekers**'and '**refugees**', people who must leave their home country because their lives are in danger there. 



**immigration** is the migration of people into a country **to live there.** So an immigrant is a person who goes to a foreign country to live there.

###  Current situation

According to the data from the latest **European conference** on migration the number of migrants arriving in Europe has increased **enormously** over the last five years. EU politicians are divided on this issue. Some of them believe that migration is a bad thing and causes lots of problems. On the other hand, other politicians **maintain** that migrants **contribute to** the developing of the economy.

### Oppose

They take jobs from local people and **push down** **pay rates** for both unskilled and skilled workers. ln fact migrants are often paid less than the legal minimum wage.



Unfortunately many migrants come into Europe illegally.



They doesn't have access to healthcare and education. That's why they sometimes **get involved in** criminal activities. l think some immigration is ok, especially if the immigrants are **asylum seekers** or **refugees** who can't return to their home countries. **Apart from** this l think European governments should put a stop to immigration.

### Support

Many employers use immigration to **plug** **labor shortages**, for example in agriculture. Farmers employ thousands of Eastern European workers to pick their crops as they can't find local workers to do the work.



in most European countries, particularly in Spain and ltaly. The economies of these countries need more workers, especially for difficult jobs that local people don't want to do. And it's important to remember that migrant workers contribute to the economy because they **pay taxes.**



People have always moved around the world. Don't forget for example the millions of Europeans who migrated to North America at the beginning of the last century. They experienced the same problems that the Africans are experiencing today.



People have always moved to where it is possible to make a living. Maybe we should get used to the idea that our society is becoming more and more **multiracial**.



### solution

Well, the EU should do more to help develop the economies of North and West Africa. This would help economic migrants, migrants who come to Europe to work, to stay at home, find a job and develop their local economies.

## Economic growth in China and India

*[From E.T 34]*

<iframe height=400 width=100% src='http://player.youku.com/embed/XMTgzNzkwMzUyMA==' frameborder=0 'allowfullscreen'></iframe>

### Current Situation

You know for the last five years the economies of these countries have been growing at almost **double digit rates**. In 2005 the Chinese economy grew by 9.9%, the Indian economy by 8%. Compare this with an average of only 1.3% in Europe's Euro zone.



### chance

I don't see these growing economies as a threat to European **producers**. I believe that China and India offer new, important markets to European **manufacturers**. You know, both countries have **middle classes** that are becoming larger and larger, these people are becoming wealthier and are looking to spend their money on **luxury** goods made in Europe.



India and China are selling much more to Europe But don't forget Tom that cheap Chinese goods have helped to keep **inflation** low in European countries. And this has helped keep **interest rates** low too. So **consumers** have been able to save money and spend this money on other things. What's more, today more and more European companies are building factories in China or are having their goods produced there.



### threat

Well, I'm rather concerned about it. And I believe that many European industrialists are concerned too. These two Asian **giants** with their enormous populations are threatening European manufacturing and jobs. The fact is that **labour costs** are so low in China and India that European manufacturers just can't compete. European industrialists are deciding to have their goods produced in these countries because labour costs are lower. If we continue like this lots of factories in Europe will close and the numbers of **unemployed** will rise.

## retired

### current situation

Are you nearing retirement, are you already retired? Perhaps you have your working life ahead of you? Anyway, one thing is for sure, the meaning of the word '**retirement**' is going to change in the future!



The traditional division of life into **three cycles**: education, employment and retirement must change. People in developed countries are living longer. By 2025 in developed countries the share of the population over 60 will have **reached** 26%. All these **pensioners** will certainly wield a lot of power. But you know experts are beginning to talk about the concept of '**active aging**'. Just think that by 2050 the average **lifespan** in developed countries will be in the mid 80's. And this increasing longevity is already starting to have a negative impact on public finances, economic growth and general living standards. 



### problems

The problem is that there is increasing pressure on **social security systems** and **public funds** for retirement and health care **expenses**. Economists are increasingly questioning the sustainability of the European **social model** with its high **welfare standards**. So, how can we solve this problem? 

### solutions

Well, governments really must encourage older people to continue working. There should be programmes for lifelong learning to help people learn up-to-date job skills as they get older. People about to retire should plan ahead and find some way of working, maybe a part-time job. Well, some American companies already have '**phased retirement**' programmes. Retired employees go to the company website where they can find project work for the company. This may last two days or two months and the retired workers can manage their own time and work when and where they want. lf they need some training to do the job they can go to the company website and take a short course using the lnternet to learn what they have to do. ln this way retired people have more money and the companies can use the skills of their retired workers.
