## informal meeting

*[From E.T 36]*

> The informal meeting is used to discuss some specific issue and is more **free flowing**  (not control).



Now we are looking and **options** for handling our online orders.



They're **going through the roof** and frankly.The lead time for delivery is blowing out.

going through the roof = Increasing rapidly in number
The lead  time time from start to finish of a process
Blowing out, becoming too great



We need to improve our performance in this area
As I see it, there are three options
In my opinion
From my point of view

The operation was is to employ more people to do the job
Another alternative is to automate the system more Can cut down the, physical handling
The third option we could outsource

Firstly, secondly, Certainly
One option, another option
Alternatively

Comparing
Let's look at the increase stuff Versus automation
Let's look at increased off, as against

On the one hand automating  has a higher capital cost than putting on more stuff
On the other hand employ more people is more expensive over long term

What mission is expensive but it's more efficient
Although admission is expensive is more efficient
Admission is expensive however is more efficient

How likely is it that will see continued growth
I'd say it's a certainty
That's a high probability Nothing, is certain in business
It's very unlikely it's quite possible, chinese problem, it's with reasonable certainty

It's unlikely

It's a certainty
It's a possibility
There is a probability
There's a high likelihood
There's no likelyhood

outsourcing is cheaper option and thr easiest, in the short term
But if we want to keep the operatio in house 
The best option is automating our system
