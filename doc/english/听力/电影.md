You can't compare independent films with **Hollywood blockbusters**!



### Hollywood film

Well, Hollywood films are more **spectacular**. They're usually high-budget productions and the money comes from the **Hollywood studios**, not from the directors!



There's more money to spend so they can **feature** famous stars.

### what is Bollywood

Well, Bollywood's **booming** and is becoming more known internationally. Bollywood is the name given to the lndian film industry, it comes from **Bombay** and Hollywood, Bollywood. Bombay's the centre of the lndian film industry. Bombay's now called **Mumbai**, but the name Bollywood is still used. 

### what is special

The films are full of colour with beautiful traditional lndian costumes and lots of lndian music and dancing. 

### problem

**Illegal copying** is the biggest problem facing the Bollywood Studios. They lose lots of money because of **piracy**. Another problem is that young **audiences** are becoming bored with the traditional **love story formula**. Today the Studios have to create **new story lines**.

A typical new film is the one that is set in a **call centre** in Mumbai and follows the lives of six young lndians working there. Did you know Lucy that many young lndian graduates now work in call centres? They answer calls in English from customers in the US and the UK.

<iframe height=400 width=100% src='http://player.youku.com/embed/XMTgzODQyMjkyMA==' frameborder=0 'allowfullscreen'></iframe>



### Brief Introduce

we pay **homage** to one of the most popular films of all time, an unforgettable Hollywood **masterpiece**. l don't think l need say more. l'm sure you all know the film we're going to talk about today: Casablanca. 



Casablanca; the amazing **cast**, the fantastic script, and of course, the unforgettable story! Yes, there'll always **be a place in my heart for** Casablanca! 



### why is it popular

Well, let's try to explain to our viewers why this film is so popular. First of all there are the performances of two of Hollywood's greatest actors: **Humphrey Bogart** and **lngrid Bergman**. 



And secondly it's a film that was able to bring romance **together with** the **serious theme** of **resistance** to the Nazis. The end result is a **passionate** love story **brimming over** with emotion. 



### Plot

Could you run through the plot for us Sanjeev? Just to **jog** our viewers' memories. 



Sure. Casablanca takes us back to a **wartime** Europe of **Nazis** and freedom fighters. The film, directed by Michael Curtiz in 1942, focuses on the character of Rick Blaine, a **cynical** American who has escaped from **occupied** France to open an **up-market** jazz bar in the Moroccan city of Casablanca. He has to choose between his love for llsa and his duty to help her husband, Laszlo, a Resistance leader, to escape from Morocco to continue his fight against the Nazis. llsa first met and fell in love with Rick in Paris. She believed her husband had been killed by the Nazis. When she discovers that Laszlo is still alive, she leaves Rick **abruptly** without explanation and returns to Laszlo, leaving Rick feeling betrayed and bitter. ln the end Rick sacrifices his love and helps Laszlo and llsa to escape to Lisbon. 



### Awards and honors

But tell us, am l correct in thinking the film won an Oscar? Three Oscars! For **best picture**, **best director a**nd **best screenplay**. lt was a **big hit** in 1942 and has been ever since. Casablanca represents Hollywood at its best. A film with **undying**, **universal appeal**. The film is still shown regularly in America. Really? Do you mean on TV or in the cinema? Both actually. You know colleges across the USA show the film every year during the week of graduation exams. This has helped keep the film popular. Well, it certainly is an unforgettable film! That's Casablanca!

## the Star Wars saga



*[From E.T 41]*



<iframe height=398 width=100% src='http://player.youku.com/embed/XMTg0OTMyNTYwNA==' frameborder=0 'allowfullscreen'></iframe>

### how many films make up the Star Wars **saga**?

Six in all.The first film, 'A New Hope', was **released** in 1977, the last film, 'Revenge of the Sith' was released in 2005. And George Lucas wrote the scripts for all the films and **directed** four of them. lrvin Kershner is the director of 'The Empire Strikes Back'and Richard Marquand directed 'The Return of the Jedi'.

### What's so special about the Star Wars films

 Lot's of things actually, Lucy. You know, the first Star Wars film back in 1977 **broke new ground** with its **special effects**. New methods were used whereby the **action shots** were taken against a blue background with real models. lt doesn't sound sophisticated compared with today's computer generated effects but 29 years ago it was **revolutionary**. ln fact the amount of time Lucas spent on the special effects almost resulted in the film not being finished.

### Why the films have been so enormously popular

We're dealing with science fiction here but really the storylines in the films draw on themes common not only to science fiction but also to classical mythology.



Then there's the obvious struggle **between Good and Bad**, there's the famous 'force' the energy field that can be used for good but also for bad, love plays a big part in the saga, as does the eternal struggle for power and domination.

### Have the films made a lot of money?

 lt's been estimated that the films, along with the TV series, books and video games that have been made around the Star Wars theme have **generated** \$20 billion over the last 29 years. 



### what about the music in the movies?

l really love the music. Yes, l think the music has played an important role in helping people to remember the films. John Williams **composed** the **scores** for all six films; the style he uses has changed as the years have **gone by.** ln the first films he associated **leitmotifs** with each character, quite a simple approach. ln the later films he changed his mind and took a richer.



### the saga definitely complete now?

l wouldn't **bet on it**! There are **rumours** that George Lucas may be working on a **sequel** but for television, not for the cinema. So, we may be seeing Luke Skywalker again soon.
