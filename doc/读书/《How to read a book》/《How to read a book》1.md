##### 这是v家的第62篇文章，共读的第2篇

[TOC]

## 写在开头

嘿嘿，这次换了一个素点的配色（我觉得阅读这种事情还是朴素点好），家人们喜欢不？



还记得我们在上篇介绍共读，并引出本次阅读书的文章（）中写到，你在阅读之前应该做一些思考（**这本书主要介绍了什么？对我有什么帮助？**）不知道大家有没有做相关的思考呢？那其实，这本书的开头就讲了，这是一本怎么样的书，它的目的是什么。



## 说明

这是《共读》栏目的正式第一篇文章，以下作一些说明：

- 以下的内容均摘抄自《How to read a book》，我加上了一点个人的总结。
- 我认为重要的句子**标红**，可能有难度的单词词组用*斜体*标明，可以长按选择翻。

- 虽然我**尽量的保留的部分的上下文**，但是毕竟还是没有原文讲的清楚，不可完全当作学习资料学习。强烈建议大家买或下载书跟小v一起看。
- 这个系列的目的是**引导阅读**，也算大家阅读过的内容的一个**回顾和整理**



## 阅读进度

本次阅读进度：`0-5%`

覆盖章节：`序言`，`第一部分的前两节`

## Preface 序言

之前介绍了一下这本书的背景（1940年发布已来，已经被翻译成多国语言，再版多次。随着如今社会的发展，人们教育水瓶的提高，本书再版目的是就为了应对当下人对阅读和知识的需求。（**这部分内容可快速略读**）

>There has been a shift of interest from the reading of fiction to the reading of nonfiction.



作者提出的第一个问题就是`阅读速度`问题，太快和太慢都不行。要根据不同的读物调整阅读速度

> One constant is that, to achieve all the purposes of reading, the *desideratum* must be the ability to read different things at different—appropriate—speeds, not everything at the greatest possible speed.

>**“When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing.”**

>the aim being to read better, always better, but sometimes slower, sometimes faster.



第二点就是正确的阅读方式和策略的学习在小学之后，很少涉及，以至于很多人的学习成长因为阅读能力受到了限制。

>Another thing that has not changed, unfortunately, is the failure to carry instruction in reading beyond the elementary level.

>Do pupils in school learn to read their mother tongue effectively? Yes and no. 
>
>Up to the fifth and sixth grade, reading, on the whole, is effectively taught and well learned. **To that level we find a steady and general improvement, but beyond it the curves flatten out to a dead level.** 
>
>This is not because a person arrives at his natural limit of efficiency when he reaches the sixth grade, for it has been shown again and again that with special tuition much older children, and also adults, can make enormous improvement. Nor does it mean that most sixth-graders read well enough for all practical purposes.
>
>A great many pupils do poorly in high school because of sheer ineptitude in getting meaning from the printed page. **They can improve; they need to improve; but they don’t.**

>*To all intents and purposes* he remains a sixth-grade reader till well along in college.



这本书重写后会覆盖到以下方面：

>a much more comprehensive and better-ordered analysis of the complex art of reading; the flexible application of the basic rules to different types of reading, in fact to every variety of reading matter; the discovery and formulation of new rules of reading; and the conception of a *pyramid* of books to read, broad at the bottom and tapering at the top

## Part One: The Dimensions Of Reading 阅读的层次

阅读的目的：**增进理解**

>This is a book for readers and for those who wish to become readers.
>
>
>
>it is for readers of books.
>
>
>
>it is for those whose main **purpose in reading books is to gain increased understanding.**



中间讲了现代社会发展，各种高科技的出现，获取知识的途径增多，让人有种错觉，好像阅读不必要了。



但是：**现代传播媒体是否真的提高了我们对世界的理解？**

>But for intelligent and curious people that was never enough. They knew that they had to read too, and they did read.

>But it may be seriously questioned whether the advent of **modern communications media has much enhanced our understanding of the world in which we live.**



信息太多也不好：

> There is a sense in which we moderns *are inundated with* facts to the *detriment* of understanding.

>One of the reasons for this situation is that **the very media we have mentioned are so designed as to make thinking seem unnecessary**



### Active Reading 主动阅读



这点很重要，必须要意识要，**阅读应该是一种主动积极活动！！**

>Since reading of any sort is an activity, all reading must to some degree be active.

>first, to call attention to the fact that reading can be more or less active, and second, to point out that the more active the reading the better.

很多人认为阅读是被动的，这绝对是一个很大的误区！

>many people think that, as compared with writing and speaking, which are obviously active undertakings, reading and listening are entirely passive. The writer or speaker must put out some effort, but no work need be done by the reader or listener.



作者举例，把阅读比作`接球`。不管是发球，还是接球，都是一种积极的活动，你得观察，跑动，思考。（否则就等着被球砸晕吧）

>On the contrary, the reader or **listener is much more like the catcher in a game of baseball.**

>The pitcher or batter is the sender in the sense that his activity initiates the motion of the ball. The catcher or fielder is the receiver in the sense that his activity terminates it. **Both are active, though the activities are different.**

>Similarly, the art of reading is the skill of catching every sort of communication as well as possible.



和棒球一样**，阅读需要作者和读者的配合**。作者有书写的技巧，读者有阅读的技巧，作者的目的是如何写让思维尽可能表达（不会故意发球让你接不到），读者的目的是如何阅读尽可能的理解作者意图和传达的信息。

> **It is *noteworthy* that the pitcher and catcher are successful only to the extent that they cooperate**. The relation of writer and reader is similar.



主动阅读包含什么？

>Reading is a complex activity, just as writing is. It consists of a large number of separate acts, all of which must be performed in a good reading.



首先明确阅读的目的：

>The Goals of Reading: **Reading for Information** and **Reading for Understanding**

> Your success in reading it is determined *by the extent to* which you receive everything the writer intended to communicate.



阅读是你的大脑和书的关系，这里面可能会存在2种关系而不是一种



>The reason is that there are two possible relations between your mind and the book, not just one.

- 第一种：他说的可能你都懂

>
>
>As you go through the pages, either you understand perfectly everything the author has to say or you do not. If you do, you may have gained information, but you could not have increased your understanding.

- 第二种：（可能更普遍）你可能部分或完全不理解书的内容，说明作者层次比你高，**但这种才能加深你的理解**

>You do not understand the book perfectly. Let us even assume—what unhappily is not always true—that you understand enough to know that you do not understand it all.

>hence that it contains something that can increase your understanding.

>With nothing but the power of your own mind, you operate on the symbols before you in such a way that **you gradually lift yourself from a state of understanding less to one of understanding more.**



因此，我们可以粗步定义一下阅读的艺术**：通过自己心智的努力，慢慢的加深理解，使自己得到提升。**这多少有点破茧而出，得到新生的感觉。

>the process whereby a mind, with nothing to operate on but the symbols of the readable matter, and with no help from outside, elevates itself by the power of its own operations.

> **To pass from understanding less to understanding more by your own intellectual effort in reading is something like pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.**

>The distinction between reading for information and reading for understanding is deeper than this.



什么情况下，我们才能实现这种阅读？

- 初始理解上的不平等（作者和读者）
- 通过自己的努力将这种不平等克服到一定范围之内。

简而言之：**我们只能从比我们更好的人身上学习**（所以啊，不是所有的书都值得阅读，不是所有的人说的道理都值关注）

>First, there is initial inequality in understanding.

>Second, the reader must be able to overcome this inequality in some degree, seldom perhaps fully, but always approaching equality with the writer.

>**In short, we can learn only from our “betters.”**



当然，作者也讨论了另一种阅读目的：娱乐

>this book is about the art of reading for the sake of increased understanding.

>Of course, there is still another goal of reading, that is entertainment.

>It is the least demanding kind of reading, and it requires the least amount of effort.



下面这句话说的好，**并不是只有娱乐的书才能给人带来娱乐，任何让你增进理解，给你带来信息的书同样可以给你带来愉悦，**甚至更高等级的愉悦。

>In fact, any book that can be read for understanding or information can probably be read for entertainment as well,



### Reading as Learning 通过阅读学习

什么是学习？

>**Getting more information is learning, and so is coming to understand what you did not understand before.**

有两种阅读学习的途径：``指导``和`发现`

> **Learning by Instruction and Learning by Discovery**

>This distinction is familiar in terms of the differences between being able to remember something and being able to explain it.



>*Enlightenment* is achieved only when you know what he means and why he says it.

>Being informed is prerequisite to being enlightened.



教导：

>Instruction occurs when one person teaches another through speech or writing. We can, however, gain knowledge without being taught.

发现：

>there would be no beginning in the acquisition of knowledge. Hence, there must be discovery—the process of learning something by research, by investigation, or by reflection, without being taught.

正如没有被动的阅读，也没有被动的学习 （还渴望不劳而获的家人醒醒吧！）

>**There is no inactive learning, just as there is no inactive reading.**



有人说**教导是有帮助的发现**：

>instruction “aided discovery.”

>Similarly, although the teacher may help his student in many ways, **it is the student himself who must do the learning.**



发现其实更难，这是一个在未知探索的过程，它需要运用很多技巧，**敏锐的观察、灵敏的记忆、宽广的想像，当然别忘了还有分析和思考的训练。**

>When, however, the learner proceeds without the help of any sort of teacher, the operations of learning are performed on nature or the world rather than on discourse.

>Thinking is only one part of the activity of learning.

>One must observe, and remember, and construct imaginatively what cannot be observed.

>The art of reading, in short, includes all of the same skills that are involved in the art of unaided discovery: keenness of observation, readily available memory, range of imagination, and, of course, an intellect trained in analysis and reflection.



很多时候阅读就是一个`老师不在场`的环境。老师在场，你可以随时不费力气的解决自己的问题和困惑，但是在老师不在场的情况下我们只能靠自己的努力去寻求解释（这也是一个学习者必须具备的基本素养）

>Yet there is good reason to place primary emphasis on reading, and let listening become a secondary concern.

>listening is learning from a teacher who is present—a living teacher—while reading is learning from one who is absent.

>If, however, you ask a book a question, you must answer it yourself.

>But if you are seeking an explanation, you have to understand it or nothing has been explained to you.



当然，这也是这本书的意义所在：**如何利用好书，让书更好的教授我们知识。**

>Therefore if we are disposed to go on learning and discovering, **we must know how to make books teach us well.** That, indeed, is the primary goal of this book.
