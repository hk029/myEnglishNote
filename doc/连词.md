# 连词

英文没有双连词，中文有

> 因为今天天气好，所以我想出门

很多人喜欢用`Because ... so`，但是这个用法是错误的，英文中不会出现双连词，你可以用because 或 so

> Because/Since/As the whether is good , I would like to go out
>
> => The weather is good, so I would like to go out

familiar  注意美式



`Though...but` 不能连用

> Although/Though he is nice, I don't like him
>
> => He is nice, but I don't like him

虽然yet可以用（副词），但是老外一般也不这么用





stingy
